# Morse Flasher
This is a project named **Morse Flasher** which **converts** any **text** or number to its corresponding **morse code** and also **flashes the flashlight** of the device according to the converted morse signal.
[Morse code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code) is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as standardized sequences of two different signal durations, called dots and dashes, or dits and dahs.
These are usually used for distant communication.And light or sound are usually used to convey these signals.

Here we used a simple package named [_torch_light_](https://pub.dev/packages/torch_light).We used a Map structure to define each alphebets or numbers corresponding to the morse code,And by iterarion through each character of the the user-entered message  converted it into morse signal.
